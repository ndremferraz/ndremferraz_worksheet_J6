## Question 2.
I ran the program at least 5 times and for all these executions the similar was the same, with the afternoon thread being run first and the greetings interleaving one after another perfectly. The only difference is that sometimes one thread would finish before the other. 

## Question 3. 
Each thread is running its individual program in parallel with the other threads. When the two other threads start the main method keeps running simultaneously, and the program waits for all threads to be done to finish its execution.
